# Student-performance-prediction-project

A web-based ML application built with Streamlit to predict student performance using Random Forest models.
The app supports classification (Pass/Fail) and regression (Score Prediction) with interactive visualizations for data insights.

#Project Overview
The Student Performance Prediction App is a web-based machine learning application designed to predict a studentâ€™s academic outcomes based on demographic, academic, and socio-economic factors.
This project demonstrates the practical application of AI in education, helping educators and institutions:

Identify at-risk students
Understand key performance drivers
Plan targeted interventions to improve results

 #Features
ðŸ”¹ Predict Pass or Fail for a student
ðŸ”¹ Estimate exam score
ðŸ”¹ Random Forest for both classification & regression
ðŸ”¹ Interactive visualizations: heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots
ðŸ”¹ Custom input for real-time prediction
ðŸ”¹ GIF animations for results (Pass/Fail)

#Technologies used
Frontend/UI:streamlit
ML/Backend:Python,scikit-learn,pandas,numpy
Visualization:seaborn,matplotlib

#Dataset
UCI Student Performance Dataset [[Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)]  
Kaggle Student Performance Dataset [[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)]

#Machine Learning Models Used
Random Forest Classifier For predicting Pass/Fail
Random Forest Regressor For predicting Exam Score
